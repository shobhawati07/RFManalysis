# RFManalysis
## RFM Analysis, also known as Recency-Frequency-Monetary Analysis, is a data-driven technique used by businesses to segment and analyze their customer base. It helps companies identify different segments of customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing them to tailor their marketing and retention strategies accordingly.
## RFM Analysis helps businesses understand their customer base and create more effective marketing and retention strategies. It's important to note that the specific scoring and segmentation criteria can vary depending on the industry and business goals. Additionally, RFM Analysis is often used in combination with other techniques to gain a more comprehensive view of customer behavior.

## RFM Analysis involves three key metrics:

## Recency (R): This metric measures how recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who have made a purchase more recently are often more engaged and active, making them potentially more valuable.

## Frequency (F): Frequency measures how often a customer makes purchases within a given time frame. Customers who make frequent purchases are typically more loyal and engaged with the brand.

## Monetary (M): Monetary represents the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases. Customers who have spent more money are considered more valuable from a revenue perspective.

The RFM model works by assigning scores or rankings to each customer based on these three metrics. 
Recency,frequency and monetary score,after that creating RFM segment.

Creation of RFM Segments

We will create two segmentation classes since, high recency is bad, while high frequency and monetary value is good.

Best Recency score = 4: most recently purchase.

Best Frequency score = 4: most quantity purchase.

Best Monetary score = 4: spent the most.

Finally created RFM score combining Recency score ,frequnecy score and monetary score together.
## Data Visulaization: To visulize the data we are using here PyGWalker, Python library which gives a tableau envoirment for our dataframe in jupyter or google colab.
